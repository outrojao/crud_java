# MY FIRST CRUD IN JAVA LANGUAGE
I'm currently learning Java, and to practice my recent knowledge, I coded this simple CRUD application in Java. 
This CRUD application performs basic operations (add, remove, edit, list) and includes additional functionality like loading product data from a .txt file and using it in the program.

# WHAT I LEARN?
- How to use regex in Java with Pattern and Matcher classes;
- How to write and read .txt files in Java;

# FUTURE PLANS:
- Conect the program to a database;
- Implement a simple GUI;
- Develop a REST API service to process database requests (CRUD operations).
